# List tracker app

I made this simple app in some of my free time when I did not have school work. This idea of this app was to get 
familiar for nodejs and express and practice my backend skills. I made this app so that my family had has a place to store and look at each other christmas.

## stack

This app uses a pretty simple stack

* Nodejs
* Express
* passport
* mongodb
* ejs
* mongoose
