# Number Trivia App
this is a trivia app where all the answers are numbers. It uses the [numbers api](http://numbersapi.com/) for the questions displays. The user can enter an answer as a multiple choice(easy mode) or just enter in the answer (hard mode).

This was made at at a UPEI hackathon. The Goal of this project was to practice front end web dev. It shows useful skills like, making requests from the browser to an api, parsing user input, ect.  

Hosted using github pages and is available online [here](http://number.logananderson.ca/)
